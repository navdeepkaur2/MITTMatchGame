# MITTMatchGame
## Requirements

* The game shuffles and hides the cards randomly when the page is loaded or the game is reset.
* Users can reveal cards by clicking each card individually.
* Users should not be able to reveal more than 1 card at a time. If several cards are clicked in succession, only the first click should register and reveal a card.
* Users should not be able to open a card that is already *open* or *matched*.
* A card that does not match should automatically hide after a set timeout period.
* A user wins once all cards have successfully been *matched*.
* Upon winning the game, the user should be presented with an alert, indicating that they have won the game and how many moves it took them.
* A user can restart the game at any time by pressing the restart button. 
This will cause all the cards to be *hidden* again, cards to be reshuffled and the moves reset to 0.
* The game should display the current number of moves a user has made. A move is considered to have occurred when a card has been shown to the user.
* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting including proper indentation and thoughtful variable names.
*Functions are effectively used for code organization and readability.
